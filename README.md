# AIVirtualMouse-FaceRecogintion
We are going to create an AI-based Mouse Controller. We will first detect the hand landmarks and then track and click based on these points. We will also apply smoothing techniques to make it more usable. Moreover, this process happens only when a predefined face is recognised
